## Anchor Text Guidelines

### Recommended Anchor Text Patterns

| Content Type    | Anchor Text Examples              | Avoid         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Pillar link     | "complete dental care in Gauteng" | "click here"  |
| Supporting link | "dental implants in Johannesburg" | "read more"   |
| Contextual link | "dental implant dentist"          | generic terms |
| CTA link        | "schedule your consultation"      | "book now"    |

### Anchor Text Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Keywords:** Include relevant keywords naturally
2. **Keep It Concise:** 2-5 words ideal
3. **Avoid Generic Text:** Never use "click here" or "read more"
4. **Vary Anchor Text:** Don't use identical anchor for all links
5. **Make It Relevant:** Anchor text should describe target content
6. **Localize When Possible:** Include location "dentist in Johannesburg"

### Anchor Text Distribution

| Anchor Type         | Percentage | Examples                       |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| Exact match keyword | 30-40%     | "dental implants Johannesburg" |
| Partial match       | 30-40%     | "implant dentist in Gauteng"   |
| Branded             | 10-15%     | "visit our clinic"             |
| Generic             | 5-10%      | "learn more" (sparingly)       |
| CTA                 | 10-15%     | "book your appointment"        |

## Link Placement Strategy

### Within Content Body

| Placement          | Purpose         | Example                         |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| First paragraph    | Context setting | Link to pillar in intro         |
| Mid-content        | Topic expansion | Link to supporting from pillar  |
| Supporting context | Cross-reference | Link between related supporting |
| Conclusion         | Next step       | CTA links to conversion pages   |

### Strategic Linking Points

**In Pillar Content:**

- When mentioning dental implants → Link to Supporting 1
- When discussing teeth whitening → Link to Supporting 2
- When addressing emergencies → Link to Supporting 3
- When covering orthodontics → Link to Supporting 4
- When discussing dentist selection → Link to Supporting 5

**In Supporting Content:**

## Link Value Distribution

### How Internal Links Flow Authority

```
Pillar Page (High Authority)
    ├──→ Supporting 1 (Medium Authority)
    ├──→ Supporting 2 (Medium Authority)
    ├──→ Supporting 3 (Medium Authority)
    ├──→ Supporting 4 (Medium Authority)
    └──→ Supporting 5 (Medium Authority)

Supporting Pages (Medium Authority)
    └──→ Pillar (Reinforces Pillar Authority)
    └──→ Related Supporting (Distributes Authority)
```

### Strategy for Authority Distribution

1. **Pillar to Supporting:** Pillar passes authority to supporting pages
2. **Supporting to Pillar:** Supporting reinforces pillar as main hub
3. **Supporting to Supporting:** Related supporting pages share authority
4. **Balanced Approach:** All pages both receive and pass authority
